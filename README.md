# Matt Dyer

Senior Data Scientist specializing in pricing, experimentation, and production machine learning systems.

I focus on building statistically rigorous, interpretable models and deploying them into real-world decision systems. My work spans experiment design, demand modeling, optimization, and AWS-based serverless pipelines that support automated pricing and operational analytics at scale.

## Areas of Focus
- Pricing and revenue optimization
- Statistical experimentation and causal learning
- Interpretable models (hierarchical, survival, Bayesian)
- ML systems and automation using serverless architectures

## Technical Stack
Python, R, SQL, AWS (Lambda, S3, SQS), Redshift, Streamlit, Git

## Selected Work
This GitHub highlights representative projects and patterns from my work:
- Pricing optimization and experimentation frameworks
- Hierarchical demand modeling and survival analysis for tenure and retention
- Bayesian bandit approaches (e.g., Thompson Sampling) for promotions optimization
- Serverless ML and analytics pipelines
- Streamlit applications for model evaluation and decision support

> Note: Most production systems and business logic are proprietary and not located in my Github. Public repositories focus on modeling approaches, system design patterns, and experimentation methodology rather than company-specific implementations.

## Professional Interests
I am particularly interested in roles where data science, experimentation, and engineering intersect—especially in domains involving pricing, forecasting, and large-scale decision systems.
